# Spade-Bot
Hello, this repo is for a home made discord bot that is focused on gambling and economy as well as a link between your discord and an Aternos minecraft server, hope you like it!


# More im depth explanations
So this bot is built on a javascript and it can do several things but first of all, you will have to create your own discord app to run it (https://discord.com/developers/applications), you can then make the .sh files executable and run the bot, run-tests.sh is basically useless but there are two main ways to launh the bot: 
1. start_gui.sh
    This start option mkes you go through a gui in your browser, DISCLAIMER: My capaacities in HTML/CSS are extremely limited so this part was entirely vibe-coded, the rest of it is ai-free!
2. start_bot_native.sh
    Thos option just runs the bot without gui

# Dependencies :
You need to install:
1. Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Run install_deps.sh, just so you guys know, I work on aarch linux and I wrote this script in a way where it automatically installs the keys and stuuf and idk if it works on other distros, tell me


# What comes next?
1. Windows
2. Nice stuff
3. Non vibe coded frontend (hopefully)


# Warnings
Some features are still broken/in dev such as store or the log page in th gui, coming soon
Have a good time and enjoy it, bye!
